# Welcome to my personal Portfolio!

## Why a new site?
After over a year since graduating from General Assembly, working through my first contracted job, and the turn of the seasons; I decided it was
time for a little update (or full rebuild for that matter)

## What to expect?
I am dusting off the React skills I neglected in the last year in favour of React Native, bringing a simple yet direct approach to building this website. 
One can expect a very to the point, yet inviting design utiliziting the simplicity of black & white.
I brought in Icons from Noun-Project to help with the polished touch.
